## Ethical and Trust Barriers Hamper Generative AI Progress in EMEA [^2]
Research by enterprise analytics firm Alteryx reveals that 76% of consumers in EMEA anticipate a significant impact from AI in the next five years, yet nearly half remain skeptical about its value. Concerns about AI-generated hallucinations, where outputs are incorrect or illogical, are prevalent. Trust in AI outputs is a major issue, with over a third of the public fearing the potential for AI to generate fake news and misuse by hackers. Business leaders are equally troubled, with half reporting issues related to misinformation produced by generative AI.

## UAE Launches New AI Model to Compete with Major Tech Giants [^3]
The UAE has made a notable entry into the global AI competition with the launch of the Falcon 2 series, developed by the Technology Innovation Institute (TII) in Abu Dhabi. This open-source generative AI model includes the text-based Falcon 2 11B and the vision-to-language Falcon 2 11B VLM. The UAE's significant investment in AI underscores its strategic position as a key player in the Middle East and has attracted attention from U.S. officials. In a coordinated move with Washington, Emirati firm G42 has shifted from Chinese investments, securing a substantial investment from Microsoft.

## OpenAI Enhances AI Content Transparency with C2PA Integration [^6]
OpenAI has joined the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) steering committee, committing to integrating the open standard's metadata into its generative AI models. This move aims to increase transparency around AI-generated content. OpenAI has started adding C2PA metadata to images produced by its DALL-E 3 model and plans to extend this practice to its upcoming video generation model Sora. This initiative helps to ensure the authenticity of digital content and builds trust in AI outputs.
